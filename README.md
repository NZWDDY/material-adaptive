# Material Adaptive
This is the github repository for the code used in the Pesto and Shrine adaptive layout demos available in http://design.google.com/resizer/

Our demos were built using [Angular 1.x](http://angularjs.org) and the [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) library.

You can also view them as standalone examples:

*  [Pesto](https://material-adaptive.firebaseapp.com/pesto/app/index.html)
*  [Shrine](https://material-adaptive.firebaseapp.com/shrine/app/index.html)

## Overview

Our goals for creating these Material Adaptive applications are:

* Validate ease-of-use to create applications with [Angular Material](http://material.angularjs.org)
* Test implementations of adaptive layouts with Angular Material
* Provide both applications and code as sample for developer starter project
* Demonstrate code styles and best practices
